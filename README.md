# W261 Machine Learning At Scale: Final Project

## Business Case - Predicting Airline Delays

The airline industry finds itself in a particularly difficult position: no one cares about how smoothly it usually operates when problems and irritations arise. The complexities of the airline industry are global in scale, with millions of travelers each day supported in the air and on the ground by huge numbers of workers in extremely expensive airports. Despite the numerous impediments, the airline industry can be surprisingly efficient and resilient.

As annoying as flight delays are for passengers, they are also the bane of the airline industry, which runs extraordinarily capital-intensive operations at low margins. Delays mean unhappy customers, lost staff time and wages, a buildup of flights which causes ripple effects for other airports, and poor overall financial results. Some sources estimate net losses as greater than $30B per year (Ball et al., 2010). In view of this situation and the potential reward, realistic parameters on a predictive machine learning model would be to estimate the probability of a given flight being delayed by 15 or more minutes based on data two hours prior to scheduled departure. Based on flight and weather data from 2015-2019, we present data preparation methods as well as the results from several different delay-predicting machine learning models trained on this data.
